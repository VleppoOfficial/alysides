Asset Loans module - preliminary design (not final, subject to change during build)

User Flow

- Lender uses assetloancreate to offer an amount of funds for the specified tokens and define a repayment schedule, while putting up the offered funds into escrow
- Borrower uses assetloantakeout to accept the conditions of the loan, and putting up the specified tokens into escrow as collateral while taking the funds stored by the assetloancreate transaction
- Borrower uses assetloanfund to add funds to the loan escrow as repayment
- Lender may use assetloanclaim to claim repaid funds from the loan escrow before the final repayment is scheduled
- Borrower uses assetloanredeem to complete the loan and redeem the collateral after all repayments have been made
- Lender may use assetloanrepo to repossess the collateral if the borrower defaults (i.e. has not repaid enough funds in time according to the repayment schedule)
- Lender may cancel the loan before it starts using assetloancancel, or forgive the loan after it starts by using assetloanredeem
- A list of sorted loans related to the user can be retrieved by assetloanlist
- Information on a specific loan can be retrieved by assetloaninfo

ALF_AGREEMENTUNLOCK - loan can be used to close Agreements if successful
ALF_ALLOWLENDERUSE - allows lender to perform operations using the collateral with modules that are supported (Token Tags)
ALF_ALLOWBORROWERUSE - allows borrower to perform operations using the collateral with modules that are supported (Token Tags)
ALF_NOCLAIMFUND - disables assetloanclaim rpc for this loan
ALF_NOEARLYREDEEM - disables assetloanredeem for borrower until all loan due dates have passed
ALF_NOEXTERNALFUNDS - only fund transactions signed by borrower pubkey are valid
