Exchanges workflow:

1. Party 1 sends invoice/request to party 2 to pay (payment) to escrow. (payment) can be coins or tokens.
The request can be for an agreement invoice (with agreement id of course), standalone invoice, or loan/deposit.
The request includes a timelock value in seconds for the requests and escrows expiry time.
P1 -> request -> P2

2. Party 2 accepts request, pays the (payment) into escrow. If the request is an agreement invoice, party 2 must reclaim deposit.
For this step the request must not be expired. The escrow has a new timelock set up, with its value inherited from the request timelock.
P2 -> (payment) -> Escrow (Exchanges 1of2 CC address)
Exchange -> deposit -> P2 (if agreement invoice)

3a. Party 1 sends (asset) to escrow, reclaims the coins/tokens that were put into escrow by party 2 at step 2.
(asset) can be coins or tokens, but must be opposite of (payment), i.e. if (payment) is in coins, (asset) must be in tokens, or vice versa. (GOOD PATH)
P1 -> (asset) -> Escrow -> (payment) -> P1

3b. Party 2 withdraws their (payment) from the escrow before party 1 fulfills their end of the deal. The timelock must be expired for this step to be available. (BAD PATH)
Escrow -> (payment) -> P2

4a. If initial request is an agreement or standalone invoice, party 2 claims (asset) put in the escrow at step 3a. (INVOICE END)
Escrow -> (asset) -> P2

4b. If initial request is a loan/deposit, party 1 sends (payment) to escrow and reclaim the (asset) from step 3a. (GOOD PATH - LOAN)
P1 -> (payment) -> Escrow -> (asset) -> P1

4c. If initial request is a loan/deposit, party 2 claims the (asset) from step 3a. The timelock must be expired for this step to be available. (BAD PATH - LOAN)
Escrow -> (asset) -> P2

5. If initial request is a loan/deposit, party 2 reclaims (payment) put in the escrow at step 4b. (LOAN END)
Escrow -> (payment) -> P2
